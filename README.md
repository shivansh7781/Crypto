## **Features**
- API integration for real-time cryptocurrency data.
- Data processing with Pandas for cleaning and formatting.
- Visualization of key metrics:
  - Market capitalization by cryptocurrency.
  - Price trends over time.
  - Trading volume distribution.
  - Price vs market capitalization scatter plot.
- Interactive and informative charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core language for scripting and processing.
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests`: For API integration.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib`: For static visualizations.
  - `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations.
  - `plotly` (optional): For interactive charts.
- **Data Source**: Cryptocurrency market API.

## **Setup and Usage**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7 or above installed.
- Required Python libraries (`requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### **Steps to Run**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/crypto-marketcap-api.git
   cd crypto-marketcap-api
   ```

2. **Configure API**:
   - Replace the placeholder API endpoint and API key (if required) in the `script.py` file:
     ```python
     API_URL = "https://api.example.com/marketcap"
     API_KEY = "your_api_key"
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

4. **View Visualizations**:
   - The script generates charts saved as images or displayed in the Python environment.
